  Six and a half years after a candle fire gutted One Sunset Park condominium in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York City homeowners are still paying thousands of dollars in property taxes every year for a building is too dangerous to enter, too costly to rebuild and too legally tangled to sell.

  Now, homeowners find themselves trapped in a legal limbo. What began as a routine fire claim has spiraled into a rare and tangled conflict involving underinsurance and the rights of rent-stabilized tenants.
</p>

   <p class="story-paragraph">
 Condominium board general counsel Theresa Racht describes this case in an affidavit as “entire process has never been done in New York.”
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
 Larry Rothchild, 50, bought a two-bedroom unit in the One Sunset Park condominium in 2015. After the fire, he stayed temporally with a friend’s home in Kensington and rent a much smaller apartment in Bay Ridge before settling in Harlem.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
 Rothchild is still spending more than $2,500 a year in property taxes on homes he can’t live in, on top of legal expenses and other expenses.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
 “We’re paying for a home we can’t live in,” said Rothchild. “This is our equity, our down payments, our savings.”
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
Under the Condominium Act, if more than 75% of a building is damaged, reconstruction must be approved by unit owners who own at least 75% of the common interest (depends on the size and number of the units they have). 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
In this case, 72.45% of owners voted against rebuilding, primarily because the estimated reconstruction cost was $24.78 million, while the maximum insurance payout was only $8.2 million. The rebuild was therefore impossible.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
The homeowners allege that the condo board failed to comply with the law required property insurance covering at least 80% of the building’s replacement cost, which caused a substantial coverage gap. And the condo board are explaining that they are doing these of “good faith” by stating Business Judgment Rule.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
After the plan to rebuild fell through, the owners voted to pursue a court-supervised partition and sale. However, a court-ordered auction in November 2023 failed, primarily because 17 units in the building remain protected under rent stabilization laws. Several tenants are currently suing to assert their “right to return” to the building once it is rebuilt — a right that state law upholds, stating that their leases do not automatically terminate due to fire or a vacate order. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
"Right now, really, everything is in an appeal posture. And we are attempting to move forward with the sale of the building in the partition case,” said Janice Goldberg, lawyer, “we are just focusing on trying to see if we can settle this one lawsuit with the with the tenants that are represented by BLS [Brooklyn Legal Services].”
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Aside from the tenant issues, the wide disparity in the building’s estimated reconstruction costs has become another major point of contention. The Zimmerman report by the architecture firm HLZA concluded that a full rebuild would cost between $25.2 million and $26.88 million. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
By contrast, real estate appraiser Guzowski estimated that the building’s replacement for value at the time of the fire was only about $7.5 million, or roughly $10 million adjusted to present value (excluding the cost of individual units and depreciation). 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
A third estimate, prepared by insurance adjustment firm Fire & Restoration LLC, placed the reconstruction cost at approximately $17.3 million.

          if (r.contentWindow === a.source) {
            var d = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px";
            r.style.height = d;
          }
    }
  });
</script>


<p class="story-paragraph">
With estimates ranging from $7 million to more than $25 million, the question of whether the building was adequately insured has become a factual dispute that cannot be resolved before trial. As a result, in September 2024, Kings County Supreme Court Justice Kerry J. Ward denied the board’s motion to dismiss the case under the Business Judgment Rule.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
The court issued a second order of sale on Dec. 5, 2024, but the timing of any actual auction still depends on whether the rent-stabilized tenants and the unit owners can reach a settlement.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
“It was like hacking a path with a machete through the jungle,” said Racht. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Because the current stalemate depends almost entirely on whether the rent-stabilized tenants’ claims can be resolved, the court has paused all substantive litigation and directed both sides to prioritize settlement discussions. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
“We have been in settlement negotiations with the rent stabilized tenants,” Goldberg said of the ongoing talks. “They want to resolve their claims to come back and be allowed to have the same apartments they had before the fire.”
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Eleanor Whitney, 44, who has since moved to Yucca Valley, California, owned a unit at One Sunset Park Condominium and lost her cat, Crackers, in the fire.

<p class="story-paragraph">
“To me, it’s so sad because it’s literally on such a prominent corner in the neighborhood and it's just sitting empty. And that’s, housing, that the city desperately needs,” said Whitney. “I still wonder like, what would it be like if I still lived there.”
