  Larry Rothchild, 51, bought a two-bedroom unit in the One Sunset Park Condominium in 2015. Over six and a half years after the building burned down and now sits at 702 44th Street in Brooklyn like a skeleton, Rothchild is still paying around $2,500 a year in New York City’s property taxes for an apartment in an uninhabitable building, which he described his taxes as paying  for “New York City’s air” on top of legal and new living expenses since the fire.  
</p>
<p class="story-paragraph">
  “We’re paying for a home we can’t live in,” said Rothchild. “This is our equity, our down payments, our savings. This was our home.”

<p class="story-paragraph">
  Six and a half years after a candle fire ignited One Sunset Park Condominium in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, homeowners found themselves trapped in a rare legal dispute due to gaps within the insurance plan that would allow for the reconstruction of the building.

  NThe owners want to sell the building, but are struggling to find potential buyers due to the rights of rent-stabilized tenants that want to return to their homes once it is sold. The potential buyer would be legally bound to honor controlled rent for 17 tenants, gaining revenue from their investment in the property.

   <p class="story-paragraph">
 “It was like hacking a path with a machete through the jungle,” condominium board general counsel Theresa Racht said.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
The apartment has still not been rebuilt because New York’s Condominium Act requires a supermajority vote when a building is severely damaged. If more than 75% of a condominium is destroyed, reconstruction must be approved by 75% owners.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
 Around three-quarters of owners voted against rebuilding because the estimated reconstruction cost was $24.78 million, while the maximum insurance payout was only $8.2 million.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
 The rebuild was therefore impossible due to underinsurance.
</p>

 <p class="story-paragraph">
The homeowners allege that the condo board failed to comply with the law requiring property insurance covering at least 80% of the building’s replacement cost, which caused this gap. The condo board says that they were buying the insurance in good faith by invoking the business judgment rule, a legal doctrine that protects board decisions made in good faith and on an informed basis from judicial second-guessing.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
After the reconstruction plan failed due to voting and insurance, the owners voted to pursue a court-supervised partition and sale. However, an auction in November 2023 failed. The potential buyer will inherit any pending lawsuits, as well as any claims to continued occupancy of the building made by tenants.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
17 units out of 54 units tenants are currently suing to assert their “right to return” to the building once it is rebuilt, a right that state law upholds, stating that their leases do not automatically terminate due to fire or a vacate order.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
"Right now, really, everything is in an appealing posture. And we are attempting to move forward with the sale of the building in the partition case,” said Janice Goldberg, litigation counsel for the One Sunset Park Condominium. “We are just focusing on trying to see if we can settle this one lawsuit with the tenants that are represented by BLS [Brooklyn Legal Services].”
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Aside from the tenant issues, another disagreement has beset One Sunset Park: the building has three different estimated rebuild costs according to Memorandum in Opposition to Motion and in Support of Cross-Motion.

            var d = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px";

<p class="story-paragraph">
A report concluded that a full rebuild would cost between $25.2 million and $26.88 million.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Another report estimated that the building’s replacement value at the time of the fire was only about $7.5 million, or roughly $10 million adjusted to present value (excluding the cost of individual units and depreciation).
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
A third estimate report stated that the reconstruction would cost approximately $17.3 million.
</p>


<p class="story-paragraph">
With estimates so different, the question of whether the building was adequately insured has become a factual dispute that cannot be resolved. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
As a result, in September 2024, Kings County Supreme Court Justice Kerry J. Ward denied the board’s motion to dismiss the case under the business judgment rule.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
The court issued a second order of sale on Dec. 5, 2024, but the timing of any actual auction still depends on whether the rent-stabilized tenants and the unit owners can reach a settlement. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
With the tenants’ claims at the core of the limbo, the court has paused the case and asked both sides to prioritize settlement discussions.
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
“We have been in settlement negotiations with the rent stabilized tenants,” Goldberg said of the ongoing talks. 
</p>

<p class="story-paragraph">
Eleanor Whitney, 44, who has since moved to Yucca Valley, California, owned a unit at One Sunset Park Condominium and lost her cat, Crackers, in the fire.

<p class="story-paragraph">
“To me, it’s so sad because it’s literally on such a prominent corner in the neighborhood and it's just sitting empty. And that's housing that the city desperately needs,” said Whitney. “I still wonder what it would be like if I still lived there.”
